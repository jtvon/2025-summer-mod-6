Homework Reflection 9

1. Write some code that will use a simulation to estimate the standard deviation of the coefficient when there is heteroskedasticity.  
Compare these standard errors to those found via statsmodels OLS or a similar linear regression model.

2. Write some code that will use a simulation to estimate the standard deviation of the coefficient when errors are highly correlated / non-independent.
Compare these standard errors to those found via statsmodels OlS or a similar linear regression model.

Show that if the correlation between coefficients is high enough, then the estimated standard deviation of the coefficient, using bootstrap errors, 
might not match that found by a full simulation of the Data Generating Process.  (This can be fixed if you have a huge amount of data for the bootstrap simulation.)
